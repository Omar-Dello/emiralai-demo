            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to EmiralAI's Privacy Policy. Your privacy is critically important to us. At EmiralAI, we have a
                few
                fundamental principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information
                    that we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>
                <li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>
                <li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is
                    shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.</li>
                <li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our
                services, to communicate with you, or to make our services better. Let's go through the information we
                collect.</p>

            <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
            <p>It's probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some
                examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic Account Information:</strong> We ask for basic information from you in order to set up
                    your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for an EmiralAI account to provide an
                    email address and password, along with a username or name — and that's it. You may provide us with
                    more information — such as your address and other information you want to share — but we don't
                    require that information to create your account.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Profile Information:</strong> If you have an account with us, we collect the
                    information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have an EmiralAI account,
                    your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your
                    public profile. Your public profile information is just that — public — so please keep that in mind
                    when deciding what information you would like to include.</li>
                <li><strong>Transaction and Billing Information:</strong> If you buy something from us, you will provide
                    additional personal and payment information such as your name, credit card information, and contact
                    information.</li>
                <li><strong>Content Information:</strong> You might provide us with information about you in the content
                    you upload to the site. For example, if you upload an image that shows your face, we might detect
                    that it contains an image of a person.</li>
                <li><strong>Communications with Us:</strong> You may also provide us with information when you respond
                    to surveys, communicate with our team about a support question, or post a question in our public
                    forums.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
            <p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Log Information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that
                    web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP
                    address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of
                    access, operating system, and mobile network information.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> We collect information about your usage of our services. For
                    example, we collect information about the actions that users perform — in other words, which
                    features you used and how. We use this information to, for example, provide our services to you, get
                    insights into how people use our services so we can make our services better, and prevent fraud.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> We may determine the approximate location of your device from
                    your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people
                    visit our services from certain geographic regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Information from Cookies & Other Technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of information
                    that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the
                    website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code
                    placed on websites and emails. EmiralAI uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help
                    us
                    identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our services, as well as track and
                    understand email campaign effectiveness.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
            <p>We use information about you for the purposes listed below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>To provide our services.</strong> For example, to set up and maintain your account, provide
                    customer service, process payments and orders, and verify user information.</li>
                <li><strong>To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our services.</strong> For example, by
                    providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our services. Or, for example, by monitoring and
                    analyzing how users interact with our services so we can create new features that we think our users
                    will enjoy.</li>
                <li><strong>To market our services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our
                        marketing.</strong> For example, by targeting our marketing messages to groups of our users and
                    advertising our services, analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns, and understanding which
                    users who have opted in to receive emails, such as our newsletters.</li>
                <li><strong>To protect our services, our users, and the public.</strong> For example, by detecting
                    security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal
                    activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and
                    property of EmiralAI and others.</li>
                <li><strong>To fix problems with our services.</strong> For example, by monitoring, debugging,
                    repairing, and preventing issues.</li>
                <li><strong>To personalize your experience.</strong> For example, to provide customized content based on
                    your interests and preferences.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Note on AI Training:</strong> We do not use your data to train our AI models without explicit
                    consent. Your privacy and control over your data are paramount to us. If we ever wish to use your
                    data for model training, we will ask for your explicit permission first.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Sharing Information</h2>
            <p>We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy.
                These are spelled out below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Vendors:</strong> We may share information about you with third-party vendors
                    who need the information in order to provide their services to us. This includes vendors that help
                    us provide our services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card
                    information, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions,
                    cloud storage services, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you,
                    customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you); those that assist us
                    with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target
                    group or improving our marketing campaigns, and by placing ads to market our services); those that
                    help us understand and enhance our services (like analytics providers); those that make tools to
                    help us run our operations (like programs that help us with task management, scheduling, word
                    processing, email and other communications, and collaboration among our teams).</li>
                <li><strong>Legal and Regulatory Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information about you in
                    response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>
                <li><strong>To Protect Rights, Property, and Others:</strong> We may disclose information about you when
                    we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights
                    of EmiralAI, third parties, or the public at large.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or
                    acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that
                    EmiralAI goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the
                    assets
                    that is transferred or acquired by a third party.</li>
                <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at
                    your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties when you authorize us
                    to do so.</li>
                <li><strong>Aggregated or De-Identified Information:</strong> We may share information that has been
                    aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For
                    instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our services.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>We work hard to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction
                and take reasonable measures to do so. We implement a variety of security measures, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintaining physical security of our facilities and equipment</li>
                <li>Restricting access to personal information to authorized EmiralAI employees and contractors</li>
                <li>Reviewing our information collection, storage, and processing practices</li>
                <li>Using SSL encryption to secure all data transmission</li>
                <li>Implementing regular security audits and assessments</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
            <p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limit the information you provide:</strong> You can choose not to provide optional account
                    information, profile information, and transaction and billing information.</li>
                <li><strong>Limit access to information on your mobile device:</strong> Your mobile device operating
                    system should provide you with the option to discontinue our ability to collect stored information
                    or location information via our mobile apps.</li>
                <li><strong>Opt out of marketing communications:</strong> You may opt out of receiving promotional
                    communications from us by following the instructions in those communications or by contacting us
                    directly.</li>
                <li><strong>Set your browser to reject cookies:</strong> You can usually choose to set your browser to
                    remove or reject browser cookies before using EmiralAI's websites, with the drawback that certain
                    features may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</li>
                <li><strong>Request your data:</strong> Depending on the applicable laws in your jurisdiction, you may
                    have the right to request a copy of your personal data from us, to have us correct or delete your
                    personal data, or to restrict or object to its processing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We generally discard information about you when it's no longer needed for the purposes for which we
                collect and use it — described in the section above on How We Use Information — and we're not legally
                required to keep it.</p>

            <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
            <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, EmiralAI may change its Privacy Policy from time to time.
                EmiralAI encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we
                make changes, we will notify you by revising the "last updated" date at the top of this page, and, in
                some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a statement to our website or sending you a
                notification). Your continued use of the Services after any change in this Privacy Policy will
                constitute your consent to such change.</p>
